    Welcome to the Apple Stage Recognition System! üåøüîç
    
    Our mission is to help in identifying apple stages whether it is fresh or rotten. Upload an image of an apple, and our system will analyze it to detect the stage of the apple. 

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Stages Recognition** page and upload an image of an apple.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify stages.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate stage detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Apple Stages Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Apple Stages Recognition System!

    ### About Us

               The Fresh and Rotten/Stale Apple Classification Dataset is a comprehensive collection of high-quality 
               images specifically curated for the purpose of training and evaluating classification models. 
               This dataset is designed to aid in the development of computer vision algorithms that can accurately distinguish between fresh and rotten/stale produce.
               
                #### Content
                1. train (933 images)
